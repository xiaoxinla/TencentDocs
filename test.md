  aii-fs -ls -r hdfs://                                      -- list the contents of a root HDFS directory, recursively 
  aii-fs -mkdir hdfs://mydir/mysubdir/mysubdir2              -- makes mysubdir2 and all directories along the way 
  aii-fs -rm hdfs://mydir/mysubdir/myfile                    -- removes myfile from mysubdir 
  aii-fs -rm hdfs://mydir/mysubdir                           -- removes mysubdir and all files and directories in it 
  aii-fs -cp c:\mylocalfile hdfs://mydir/myremotedir         -- copy mylocalfile into myremotedir 
  aii-fs -cp -r c:\mylocaldir hdfs://mydir/myremotedir       -- copy mylocaldir into myremotedir, recursively 
  aii-fs -cp -r c:\mylocaldir\* hdfs://mydir/myremotedir     -- copy mylocaldir's contents into myremotedir, recursively 
  aii-fs -cp c:\mylocaldir\\a hdfs://mydir/myremotedir/b     -- copy file a from mylocaldir to myremotedir and rename to b 
  aii-fs -cp -r hdfs://mydir/myremotedir c:\mylocaldir       -- copy myremotedir into mylocaldir, recursively 
  aii-fs -cp -r hdfs://mydir/myremotedir/* c:\mylocaldir     -- copy myremotedir's contents into mylocaldir, recursively
